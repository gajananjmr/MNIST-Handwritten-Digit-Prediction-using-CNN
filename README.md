# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Prediction-using-CNN
This project builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize digits from images in the MNIST dataset. It achieves high accuracy in predicting digits from grayscale 28x28 pixel images, which is a foundational task in computer vision and deep learning.
